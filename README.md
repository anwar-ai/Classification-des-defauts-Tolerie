# Classification-des-defauts-"Tolerie"

Automatic recognition method for hot-rolled steel strip surface defects is extremely important to the
steel surface inspection system. In order to improve the tolerance ability of local deformations for current
feature extraction methods, a scattering operator is applied to extract features for defect recognition.
Firstly, a scattering transform builds non-linear invariants representation by cascading wavelet transforms
and modulus pooling operators, which average the amplitude of iterated wavelet coefficients. Then,
an improved network named the scattering convolution network (SCN) is introduced to build largescale invariants.  
defect database is constructed to evaluate the effectiveness of the feature extraction methods for defect
recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the SCN method presents the excellent performance
of defect recognition under the influence of the feature variations of the intra-class changes, the illumination and grayscale changes. Even in the less number of training, the SCN method can still achieve the
moderate recognition accuracy.
